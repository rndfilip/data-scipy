## Optimize with SciPy

A good data analyst in Python shouldn't only know how to manipulate and visualize data. They should also be able to solve mathematical problems based on this data.

Welcome to [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/general.html), a handy complement to `NumPy` for advanced mathematical computations!

SciPy is a must-know library to perform advanced mathematical operations, such as:
- Complex and differential equations
- Optimization
- Linear algebra (expand on numpy.linalg)
- Functional analysis
- Statistical analysis
- Image processing
- ...

Scipy is powerful because it's a non-specialized mathematical tool offering infinite possibilities. Although we won't use it a lot in the bootcamp, preferring more specific and user-friendly libraries such as Scikit-learn for machine-learning, it's important to know SciPy for your culture and progress later on!

Don't forget to `pip install scipy` before starting the challenge. When you are ready, open the `03-scipy.ipynb` notebook in this folder for a relaxing and guided introduction to the library.
